# 🎲 Random Number Picker

A simple tool to randomly pick numbers from a list. Useful for giveaways, raffles, or any lottery-style selection.

## 📁 Setup Instructions

1. **Create the numbers file**  
   Create a file named `numbers.txt` in the root of the project. Paste your list of numbers into it — one number per line.

   **Example:**
   ```
   1234
   5678
   8976
   6847
   1275
   ```

2. **Run the sorter**  
   Open the `sorter.php` file in your browser to process the numbers:

   ```
   http://yourdomain.com/sorter.php
   ```

3. **Use the Picker UI**  
   Open the `index.html` file in your browser and click on the **Load** button to load and display the numbers.

✅ Done! You’re ready to randomly pick numbers.
